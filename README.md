Scala implementation of concepts from the
[The Art Of Multiprocessor Programing](http://www.elsevierdirect.com/companion.jsp?ISBN=9780123705914) book.

This is largely intended as a vehicle for me to understand the concepts in the book, and not for any production
use. Also, the java.util.concurrent package provides most of this anyways.
